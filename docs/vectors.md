# Vectors
Vector object represents a three-dimensional [Euclidean vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector).

This is most commonly used to refer to a specific point in the game world.

## Members
Vector consists of three scalar float values: `x`, `y`, `z`

All of these can be simply retrieved like values in a Lua table.

```lua
local vec = Vector(1,2,3)
print(vec.x)
print(vec.y)
print(vec.z)
```

## `Vector` <Badge type="info" text="constructor" />
Vector can be constructed directly using a function of the same name, or it can be a result of various functions such as [GetPosition](/characters#getposition) of a player character object.

Syntax:
```lua
Vector Vector( [ float x, float y, float z ] )
```

Example:
```lua
local vec0 = Vector()
local vec1 = Vector(5)
local vec2 = Vector(5,10)
local vec3 = Vector(5,10,4)
```

## `length` <Badge type="info" text="function" />
Returns the magnitude of a vector.

Syntax:
```lua
float Vector:length()
```

Example:
```lua
local vec = Vector(1,2,3)
print(vec:length())
```

## `getNormalized` <Badge type="info" text="function" />
Returns a normalized (unit) vector. This is a vector with the same direction, but length (magnitude) of 1.

Syntax:
```lua
Vector Vector:getNormalized()
```

Example:
```lua
local vec = Vector(1,2,3)
print(vec:getNormalized():length()) -- always 1
```

## `getDistanceTo` <Badge type="info" text="function" />
Returns the distance between two vectors in centimeters.

Divide this by 256 if you want a distance in tiles.

Syntax:
```lua
Vector Vector:getDistanceTo( Vector other )
```

Example:
```lua {3}
local pos1 = player1:GetPosition()
local pos2 = player2:GetPosition()
local distance = pos1:getDistanceTo(pos2) / 256
print("Players are distanced " .. distance .. " tiles apart.")
```
