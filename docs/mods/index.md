# Mod compatibility

In theory, Ratchet can communicate with all the game functions and all other mods.
However, support for these functions has to be implemented into Ratchet.

I've already implemented support for some of the most popular mods.

**Currently supported mods are:**
- [Tot ! Chat](/mods/totchat)
- [Tot ! Sudo](/mods/totsudo)
- [Tot ! Admin](/mods/totadmin)
- [Tot ! Custom](/mods/totcustom)
- [Roleplay Redux](/mods/redux)
- [Knight's Sanity](/mods/knights-sanity)

Would you like to suggest compatibility with another popular mod? \
Let me know about your idea on my [Discord](https://discord.gg/3WJNxCTn8m).

## Communication with your own mod
You can use Ratchet interface API to [trigger events and receive updates](/events#trigger-from-devkit).
