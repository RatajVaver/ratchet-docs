# Actor
Actors represent objects that exist in the game world. Every player character, NPC, building piece, decoration, container, map object, mod controller, and even the sky is an actor.

Actor type in Ratchet is used to contain functions that are shared across all of those objects and can be used on any type that inherits from an actor.
